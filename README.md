## Business Case Introduction ## 
#### Shipt Business Model and Problem Areas #### 
Shipt’s current business model members of the local community sign up to work as delivery
workers or drivers for grocery and everyday essentials. Shipt has a large data set of both delivery
workers as well as customers (end users of the platforms).
1. The first problem we have identified is that Shipt currently allows users to place
orders for out of stock products.
2. The second problem identified is that a few workers are overbooked for deliveries and
not all workers are able to maximize their working hours due to misallocation of delivery
orders.
3. The third problem identified is that the estimated time delivery for the products is
inaccurate and unreliable.
